# Walk-Forward-Backtesting-of-Portfolio-Strategies
This study applies a walk-forward backtesting approach with rolling windows and randomized historical data sampling to empirically evaluate multiple portfolio construction strategies, comparing their performance using risk-adjusted return metrics.

This study uses a vanilla portfolio walk-forward (aka rolling-window) Backtesting approach with daily historical market data. Generate 100 2-year datasets from historical market data on a randomized fashion by randomly choosing different periods of time and randomly choosing a subset of the universe of securities. Empirically investigate the performance of the following investment strategies:


o Equally weighted portfolio

o Markowitz’s mean-variance portfolio (MVP)

o Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP)

o Maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio (MSRP)

o Inverse Volatility Portfolio (IVP)

o Risk parity portfolio (RPP)

o Most diversified portfolio (MDP)

o Maximum decorrelation portfolio (MDC)


Analysis of the results of the backtesting results considering alternative risk-adjusted performance metrics (e.g., returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sterling ratio, drawdown).
